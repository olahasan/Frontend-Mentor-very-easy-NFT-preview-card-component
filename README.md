## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS variables (`:root`) for maintaining a consistent color scheme and how to structure a responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid. Here are some code snippets that I am proud of:

```css
:root {
  --Soft-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
  --Cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  --Very-dark-blue-main-BG: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
  --Very-dark-blue-card-BG: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
  --Very-dark-blue-line: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and exploring more advanced CSS techniques. I also aim to enhance the accessibility of my projects.
